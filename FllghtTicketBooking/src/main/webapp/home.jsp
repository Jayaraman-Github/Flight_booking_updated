Users can select flights, seats, and add-ons, proceeding to payment and confirmation. It integrates payment gateways for secure transactions and issues electronic tickets or boarding passes. It often includes features like seat maps, real-time updates, and notifications for changes or upgrades. The system's backend manages inventory, updates schedules, and coordinates with airlines to ensure accuracy. It enhances user experience by providing multiple choices and streamlining the booking process, ultimately simplifying travel planning.
